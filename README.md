## Pomodoro App

- Project's Live Preview url - https://application-pomodoro.netlify.app

## Key features

- Classic Pomodoro Logic: The app incorporates the classic Pomodoro Technique, where you work for a set period (typically 25 minutes), followed by a short break (usually 5 minutes). After a few Pomodoros, you can take a longer break.
- Customizable Intervals: You can customize the duration of the Pomodoro intervals, short breaks, and long breaks to suit your preferences and work style.
- Persistent Settings: Your interval settings are persisted between sessions, so you don't have to adjust them every time you use the app.
- Audio Effects: The app includes audio notifications to alert you when a Pomodoro interval starts, ends, or when a break is over, helping you stay focused and on track.
